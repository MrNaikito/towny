[spoiler=Changelog][B]Changelog[/B]
v0.76.2.0:
    - Fixed economy errors when using register and iCo6.
    - Fixed an error caused by players setting a town or nation bank cap as a double (now accepts 0.0).
    - Added sanity checking on values pulled from the config.yml.
    - Updated a few nation commands to report the command format insted of throwing errors.
    - Tidied Startup log data
    - Fixed Wild permissions.
    - Refactored '/town spawn' with new config options for when the target town is part of your nation,
      or an allied nation. Each can have their own cost and has their own permission.
    - Town spawn permissions have been changed to:

      - towny.town.spawn.* : Grants all Spawn travel nodes
      - towny.town.spawn.town : Ability to spawn to your own town.
      - towny.town.spawn.nation : Ability to spawn to other towns in your nation.
      - towny.town.spawn.ally : Ability to spawn to towns in nations allied with yours.
      - towny.town.spawn.public : Ability to spawn to unaffilated public towns.
    - Added missing permission nodes to support...
      - towny.wild.*
    - Fixed a bug preventing players placing fences if they are admins.
	- Adjusted wilderness permissions
	  Towny will first check for permisison nodes.
	  If no permissions are found the wild_ignore list is checked.
	  If none of the above give permissions the worlds Wilderness zone settings are checked.
	- Enabled use of the following commands for admins while still using permissions.
	  '/townyworld set usedefault'
	  '/townyworld set wildperm'
	  '/townyworld set wildperm [build,destroy,switch,ItemUse]'
	  '/townyworld set wildignore xx,xx,xx'
	  '/townyworld set wildname Wildy'
	- Added a fix for tags in data files crashing towny on load.
	- Fixed town spawns to correctly follow config and permissions settings.
	- Fixed NullPointerException generated by onPlayerInteractEvent.
	- Fixed message when setting Town tags to not say nation.
	- Fixed '/nation deposit' error message.
	- Added handling of World initialization to fix a bug when creating new worlds with Multiverse.
	- Permit residents not in town to use public spawns again.
	- Corrected permissions node checking to match those in the config for spawn travel.
	- Removed a lot of debug spam from permission checking.
	- Fix for a possible error on shutdown with active warzones.
	- Fix so players can only attack other towns IF the correct number of players are online on BOTH sides.
	- If your town/nation is attacked with warflags the attackers will automatically be set as enemies (allows you to attack back).
	- Fixed renaming a town when it's also a capitol failing to update the nation.
	- Removed dependency on Bukkit to report the world list at startup (it's not always complete).
	- Fixed a startup error on fresh installs.
	- Towns which have unclaimed their HomeBlock (or all TownBlocks) no longer corrupt the data files on a shutdown.
	- Towns are now able to move worlds by moving their homeblock to that world.
	- Fixed Account creation for towns and nations when using BOSEconomy.
	- Towny now uses the correct currency type (coins/dollars) as defined in your Eco plugin.
	- Added '/town set tag clear' and '/nation set tag clear' to reset tags.
	- Titles and surnames are now reset if the player is not in a nation.
	- Added '/plot clear' for mayors.
	  If a plot is owned by the town (not a resident) the mayor can stand in the plot and type this command to remove all block types as specified in mayor_plotblock_delete.
	  This setting is per world so transfers to the world data files at startup.
	- Added upkeep charging based upon the number of town plots (town_plotbased_upkeep) - thanks to phex
	- Slight reorgnise of TownyUniverse (if you hook towny be sure your functions have not moved).
	- Changed the daily timer to a set time each day. Configure new_day_time to set when you want taxes to be collected.
	  eg. 15h30m would attempt to collect taxes at 3:30pm.
	- Returned the setting day_interval so you can configure the length of a day.
	  If you set a day length of 12 hours (12h), taxes will be collected on a 12 hourly cycle, instead of a 24 hour one.
	  new_day_time should be set to less than the day_interval, but it will default to the same, if it's incorrectly set.
        - Fixed an error in fetching the resident on new cache creation (caused by code reorganising).
v0.76.3.0:
	- Fixed an error when not using a currency type with Essentials Eco.
	- Force load the destination chunk when teleporting. Attempt to prevent the falling through the world bug.
	- If wild_revert_on_mob_explosion is enabled, the explosions no longer drop any blocks.
	- Simplfied Plugin interfacing for Economy plugins to a single setting of using_economy.
	  Towny will first attempt to use Register.jar. If it's not present
	  it will fall back to the legacy support for iConomy 5.01.
	- Added a Permission handler to towny so it will now support GroupManager, PEX, bPermissions, Permissions 2/3 + (bridges) and Bukkit Perms.
	- Admins can now pick, choose and modify which notifications are shown when a player walks from plot to plot. Check the new section 'Town Notifications' in the config.
	- Town notifications now show a money formatted price.
	- Fixed '/town new' and '/nation new' to properly follow the settings in config if permissions are disabled.
	- If not using Eco, Towny will no longer error when deleting/renaming towns/nations, or upon a new day.
	- When using SuperPerms you can now use the following nodes with towny.
	  prefix.prefixhere
	  suffix.suffixhere

	- Town spawn cost now outputs correctly formatted by the settings in your economy plugin.

	- Added Plot level permissions and commands to control them.
	  '/plot perm' displays the current plots permissions.
