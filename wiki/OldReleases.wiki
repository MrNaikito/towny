= Introduction =

Here you can find information on old releases of Towny.

== New in 0.76.3.0 ==

    * New commands:
      * None
          
    * New permission nodes:
      * When using SuperPerms you can now use the following nodes with towny.
        * prefix.prefixhere
        * suffix.suffixhere
        * towny_maxplots.x (with x being a number eg towny_maxplots.2)
        
    * Added:
      * Force load of chunks when using /town spawn, to stop voids.
      * If wild_revert_on_mob_explosion is enabled, there are no drops anymore.
      * Simplfied Plugin interfacing for Economy plugins to a single setting of using_economy. Towny will first attempt to use Register.jar. If it's not present it will fall back to the legacy support for iConomy 5.01.
      * Added a permission handler, detecting and supporting all Permission plugins.
      * Admins can now pick, choose and modify which notifications are shown when a player walks from plot to plot. Check the new section 'Town Notifications' in the config.
      * Added a seperate thread for Town Claim to relieve the lag caused by Chunk snapshot generation.
      * Added access from console for '/ta givebonus', and expanded to allow a town or a player to give the bonus to. (bonus given to the player is directly transfered to the town)
      * Pistons can now push between town owned townblocks.
      
    * Bug Fixes!
      * Fixed an error with Essentials Eco's currency type.
      * Fixed '/town new' and '/nation new' to properly follow the settings in config if permissions are disabled.
      * Fixed modplayername in chat format generating duplicate entries.
      * Towny World commands are now admin only again.
      * Fixed a world bug where Plot revert was following wild revent instead of it's own setting.
      * Fixed town spawn when not using any permissiosn plugins.

== New in 0.76.2.0 ==

    * New commands:
      * /plot clear - For mayors. If a plot is owned by the town (not a resident) the mayor can stand in the plot and type this command to remove all block types as specified in mayor_plotblock_delete. This setting is per world so transfers to the world data files at startup.
      * /nation set tag clear - Removes a tag for a nation.
      * /town set tag clear - Removes a tag for a town.
          
    * New permission nodes:

      * - towny.town.spawn.town : Ability to spawn to your own town.
      * - towny.town.spawn.nation : Ability to spawn to other towns in your nation.
      * - towny.town.spawn.ally : Ability to spawn to towns in nations allied with yours.
      * - towny.town.spawn.public : Ability to spawn to unaffilated public towns.    
        
    * Added:
      * Added upkeep charging based upon the number of town plots (town_plotbased_upkeep) rather than resident count. - thanks to phex
      * Changed the daily timer to a set time each day. Configure new_day_time to set when you want taxes to be collected.
        eg. 15h30m would attempt to collect taxes at 3:30pm.
        
    * Bug Fixes!
      * Fixed economy errors when using register and iCo6.
      * Fixed Wild permissions.
      * Fixed all issues found in 0.76.1.0 release

    * Added support for Register 2.0 (Register.jar) - Supports iConomy5, iConomy6, EssentialsEco, BOSEconomy.

    * Added:
      * (Online) to title Resident Status
      * Neutral in Nation status.
      * Plot Regeneration
        When a town plot is unclaimed (by a player or through upkeep) it will slowly begin to revert to a pre town state.
        Blocks will slowly change back to whatever blocks we're present at the moment the town block was claimed.
        You can configure certain block types you don't want restored to prevent players exploiting regen for diamond ores.
        Block types to not restore are configured in block_ignore in the worlds txt file data/worlds/worldname.txt
        Does not affect plots claimed pre-0.76.1
      * Added a block deletion function to remove specified blocks when a town block becomes unclaimed (By a player or through upkeep.)
        This is useful for removing Lockette/Deadbolt signs on doors and chests.
        Default list includes doors, signs, torchs, redstone + redstone accessories and is set in the config.yml
        Block types to remove are configured in unclaim_delete in the worlds txt file data/worlds/worldname.txt
      * Added a max_tax_amount and max_tax_percent to the config for towns. Defaults to 1000 and 25% respetively.
      * Titles and surnames can now contain spaces.
      * Added a new setting 'regen_delay'.
        This setting is in seconds. It will allow players to break protected blocks in the wild and towns, even if they dont have permission.
        Blocks in the switchID list cannot be destroyed.
        The blocks will drop no loot and will regenerate after the specified time.
        Defaults to 0 (disabled). This shouldn't be used, will probably be worked into war updates.
      * Added a broadcast if a Nation is disbanded due to a town deletion.
      * Added a new Default new world setting (wild_revert_on_mob_explosion). When enabled this will replace blocks destroyed by creature explosions in the wild.
      * Towny will now clean up it's backup folder. Default time to keep backups is 90 days (configurable in config).
      * Players can no longer attack another players tamed wolf if in a non PVP area (can attack own).
      
    * Bug Fixes!
      * Fixed timers in the config.
      * Fixed and error with /town claim #|auto
      * Explosions in the nether caused by using beds are now blocked if a town is there and set to block explosions. However, the fires it generates can not be blocked.
      * Fixed when players are added to the default town they are unable to use '/town leave'.
      * Town data files should now be correctly deleted (moved to the deleted folder) upon removal.
      * Fixed Town and Nation tags size limit.
      * Fixed default Bukkit Permissions to deny instead of allow.
      * Fixed last timer for deleting old residents.
      * Fixed '/xxx claim auto' commands for town and resident.
      * Fixed '/plot unclaim xx' command. Now errors if it's an invalid entry.
      * No more sneak jump to avoid the cheat protection.
      * Fixed resetting tags using '/town set tag '.
      * Fixed overwriting custom language files.
      * Fixed default switch and item use permissions for ally and outsider.
      * Finally fixed the elusive error when getLastLocation() throws a NullPointerException.
      * Fixed an infinite loop when a player uses a fly hack over void.

== New in 0.76 ==

    * New commands:
      * /town online - Shows how many people in your town are online.
      * /nation online - Show how many people in your nation are online.
      * /town buy bonus {amount} - Allows mayors to buy more townblocks without adding residents to their town.
        The price is set in the config at {{{price_purchased_bonus_townblock: '25.0'}}}.
        A maximum amount of townblocks that a mayor can purchase is also in the config at {{{max_purchased_blocks: '0'}}}.
      * /ta toggle withdraw - Disables mayors, kings and assistants from withdrawing money from their town banks.
        An extra command that works together with the option bank cap set in the config at {{{bank_cap: '0'}}}.
    
    * Added town bank caps and a toggle to enable/disable withdrawls from town banks (prevent players hiding money in towns on PVP worlds) - thanks phrstbrn
    
    * Bug Fixes!
      * Fixed the shutdown of the Teleport warmup timer on restarts.
      * Fixed enabling Devmode, debug and reading integers from the config.
      * Fix for deleted residents in friend lists causing errors upon deletion, and the same error with nation deletion and enemy/ally lists.
      * Prevent sticky pistons pulling blocks across plot boundaries (if different owners).
      * Fix for getLastLocation() needing to throw a NullPointerException. The players location is now set upon creation of the cache.
      * Fixed old resident deletion for the new config system using seconds instead of milliseconds.
      * Towny now correctly defaults to Bukkits Permissions if using_permissions is set to false in the config.
      * Added XcraftGate to the plugin.yml as a recognised multiworld plugin.
    
    * Added a new unclaim_delete under Plot management in global_town_settings. This will delete any items listed when a town unclaims a plot or a town is deleted.
      * Ruined towns can now have all torches removed, to make looters exploring the ruins need torches.
      * All signs (including Lockette signs) can be removed automatically.
    
    * Added a Maxplots permissions node.
      * If a group doesn't have this node or the node is set to -1 Towny will default back to the max_plots_per_resident in config.
      Setting max_plots_per_resident to -1 with no permission node, or a node set to -1 will allow infinite plots.
      * Example usage:
      {{{
      		groups:
      		  Default:
      		    default: true
      		    permissions:
      		    - general.spawn
      		    inheritance: []
      		    info:
      		      prefix: ''
      		      build: true
      		      suffix: ''
      		      towny_maxplots: 1
      		  Admins:
      		    default: false
      		    permissions:
      		    - '*'
      		    inheritance:
      		    info:
      		      prefix: ''
      		      build: true
      		      suffix: ''
		      towny_maxplots: -1
    }}}
