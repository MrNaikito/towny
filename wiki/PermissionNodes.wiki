#summary Towny Permission Nodes.

= Introduction to Permission Nodes =

Towny makes use of Permission nodes to customize the Towny experience to different player-ranks.

Using a permission plugin such as Group Manager, Pex, bPerms is highly recommended. If you do not use a permissions plugin make sure that Towny's config has using_permissions: false. (It is not recommended to not use a permissions plugin, there are some very useful parts of towny which cannot be customized without using a permissions plugin.

= Info/Option Nodes =

  This is similar to a permission node as it is added to your permission nodes file(s). Added to the info: section of Groupmanagers' groups or the options: section of PEX's groups.
  
  * Setting default chat channels/modes on join to the server.
    * towny_default_modes: 'tc,nc,a,m,map,townclaim'
      * sets the default modes on residents, found in the /res set mode command stub.
  
  
  * towny_maxplots: {number}
    This info node is used to limit the number of plots a player can own based on what permissions group they are in. If a group doesn't have this node or the node is set to -1 Towny will default back to the max_plots_per_resident in config.
    Setting max_plots_per_resident to -1 with no permission node, or a node set to -1 will allow infinite plots.
  
    Example:
    {{{
  		groups:
  		  Default:
  		    default: true
  		    permissions:
  		    - general.spawn
  		    inheritance: []
  		    info:
  		      prefix: ''
