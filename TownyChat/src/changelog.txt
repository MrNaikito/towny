v0.1:
	- Initial release
v0.2:
	- Fixed players entering regex fields in chat crashing {msg}.
	- changed PLAYER_CHAT event to run earlier so we triger before other chat plugins.
	  If players are using chat modes we need to run first to cancel the chat event for other plugins.
v0.3:
	- TownyChat now only enables itself if Towny successfully starts.
	- Fixed missing {} around modplayername.
v0.4:
	- Fixed custom channel chat not showing in the console.
v0.5:
	- Added auto modes for chat.
	  Type '/tc' to set town chat mode. All text typed from then on will be sent to town chat.
	  While in a chat mode you can still talk in other channels by using the channel commands eg. '/nc hi'.
	  While in a chat mode you can talk in global chat with '/g text here'.
	  to clear all chat modes '/g'.
	- Added a new permission node for global chat ('/g') of 'towny.chat.global'.
	- Added {worldname} as an accepted entry.
	- Fixed '/g' mode to add formatting.
v0.6:
	- Changed global chat to pass through bukkits chat process instead of our own (allows other plugins to see it again).
v0.7:
	- Added support for Essentials mute and ignore features. Players on ignore will still be seen in town and nation chat.
	- Added craftIRC 3.1 support
	
	  Add a channel tag of 'admin' to the
	  receiving channel in the craftIRC config.
	  
	  Disable Auto paths and add the following to the 'paths:' section

	    - source: 'minecraft'
	      target: 'admin'
	      formatting:
	        chat: '%message%'
	        
	    - source: 'admin'     # These are endpoint tags
	      target: 'minecraft'    #
	      formatting:
	        chat: '%foreground%[%red%%ircPrefix%%sender%%foreground%] %message%'
v0.8:
	- Fixed {townformatted} and {nationformatted} to display correctly.
	- Updated to use new per world channel formats.
v0.9:
	- TownyChat now passes player chat to Dynmap.
v0.10:
	- Code rewrite for new code locations in Towny.
	- Added a spam filter so players can only send one message every two seconds.
	- Added the ability to restrict channel ranges.
	
	  All custom channels (not town or nation) can now have an extra value
	  appended to signify a range limit on chat.
	  
	  -1 = no limits
	   0 = same world only
	  any positive value = limited range (blocks) in the same world.
	  
	  eg. - /g,,,towny.chat.global,-1
	        or a local channel that covers 100 blocks range
	        /l,&f[local],&f,towny.chat.local,100
	        
	- Added a new mode '/towny spy', or '/res set mode spy'.
	  This requires you have the permission node 'towny.chat.spy' and be using TownyChat.
	  If you toggle this mode on you will be able to see all town/nation/global, and all custom channel chat.
	- If a player doesn't have the 'towny.chat.global' permission node, any open chat will pass through for any other plugins to handle.
v0.11:
	- Fixed channel tag for the global channel.
	- Fixed range test trying to cross worlds.
v0.12:
	- Major rewrite to move all channel handling into TownyChat.
	- All chat channels are now defined in their own file 'Channels.yml' found in the Towny/Settings folder.
	- Range limits can now be applied to town and nation chat.
	- You can create two identical channels, one with a range limit and one without. The player will use whichever they have permission for.
	- towny_default_modes now uses the full chat channel name. To allow use of the default channel it would be towny_default_modes: 'general'
	- Moved ALL chat settings to 'ChatConfig.yml' found in the Towny/Settings folder.
