      * Towny.jar is required at all times,

      * Questioner.jar is required if you want players to receive invites to towns, instead of being added automatically.
    * If you use any economy plugin other than iConomy 5.01 you will be required to download [http://www.palmergames.com/downloads/registerrel/Register.jar Register.jar] and put it in your plugins folder.
