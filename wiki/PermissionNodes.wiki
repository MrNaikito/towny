= Info Nodes =

  This is similar to a permission node as it is added to your permission nodes file(s).
  
  * towny_maxplots: {number}
    This info node is used to limit the number of plots a player can own based on what permissions group they are in. If a group doesn't have this node or the node is set to -1 Towny will default back to the max_plots_per_resident in config.
    Setting max_plots_per_resident to -1 with no permission node, or a node set to -1 will allow infinite plots.
  
    Example:
    {{{
  		groups:
  		  Default:
  		    default: true
  		    permissions:
  		    - general.spawn
  		    inheritance: []
  		    info:
  		      prefix: ''
  		      build: true
  		      suffix: ''
  		      towny_maxplots: 1
  		  Admins:
  		    default: false
