[spoiler=Changelog][B]Changelog[/B]
v0.75.0:
    - Added sanity checking to prevent colour codes in titles and surnames, and a notification message when a title/surname is cleared.
    - Removed console spam from 'send message'.
    - Disabled the use of '/town new' and '/town claim' in worlds where Towny is disabled.
    - Added 'disable_modify_chat' for those not wanting Towny to make any changes.
    - Fixed an error if a player uses '/town spawn' after logging in, but before moving. This caused the player cache to be empty.
    - All console messages should now have their colour codes removed correctly.
    - New config.yml handling code means no need to delete config at each upgrade. (thanks dumptruckman)
    - Fixed town spawn being lost at load when using non standard (16x16) plot sizes.
    - Allow the ignition of obsidian for lighting portals, even when fire spread is disabled in a town.
    - Durations specified in the config are now in seconds rather than milliseconds.
    - Implemented Towny's own teleport_warmup_time for town spawns.
    - Added a command '/townyadmin reset'. Wipes all settings and generate/load a default config.yml.
    - Title and Surnames can now be limited in length by the setting 'max_title_length' in config.yml.
    - Towny is now an observable object.  This allows other plugins to observe events that happen in Towny.

    - Better formatting for times in the config eg. 1d6h20s.
    - Fixed a bug when using Max distance between towns on a fresh install not allowing the first town to be founded.
    - Fixed a bug when using essentials teleport warmup where admins would be teleported twice.
    - Fixed a bug where players with no town we're not able to use public town spawns.
    - Fixed a bug where plot claim was not taking money from a player.
    - Added new plot types and commands to support.
      '/plot set reset/shop'   - Sets a plot as a Shop plot or resets to a normal plot.
      '/town set shopprice $$' - Set the towns default price on shop plots.
      '/town set shoptax $$'   - Set the town tax rate on shop plots.
                                 (a shop plot is charged an extra tax on top of any plot taxes.)
    - Added /towny map big, which fills the entire chatbox (after pressing t) with the map.
    - Expanded commands:
      '/plot [claim/unclaim/nfs] [circle/rect] [radius]'
      '/plot fs within [circle/rect] [radius]'
      '/plot fs [$] within [circle/rect] [radius]'
    - Commands still accepted
      '/plot claim [radius]'
      '/plot fs'
      '/plot fs [$]'
    - Paintings can no longer be placed in the wilderness if the player doesn't have the correct permissions.
    - All /townyworld commands are now accessable via the console. Append a suffix of the world name to any command other than '?' and 'list'. eg. '/tw toggle fire world_nether'.

        groups:
          Default:
            default: true
            permissions:

          Admins:
            default: false
            permissions:
            - '*'
            inheritance:
            info:
              prefix: ''
              build: true
              suffix: ''
              towny_maxplots: -1
