v0.76.3.0:
	- Fixed an error when not using a currency type with Essentials Eco.

	- If wild_revert_on_mob_explosion is enabled, the explosions no longer drop any blocks.
	- Simplfied Plugin interfacing for Economy plugins to a single setting of using_economy.
	  Towny will first attempt to use Register.jar. If it's not present
	  it will fall back to the legacy support for iConomy 5.01.
	- Added a Permission handler to towny so it will now support GroupManager, PEX, bPermissions, Permissions 2/3 + (bridges) and Bukkit Perms.
	- Admins can now pick, choose and modify which notifications are shown when a player walks from plot to plot. Check the new section 'Town Notifications' in the config.
	- Town notifications now show a money formatted price.
	- Fixed '/town new' and '/nation new' to properly follow the settings in config if permissions are disabled.
	- If not using Eco, Towny will no longer error when deleting/renaming towns/nations, or upon a new day.
	- When using SuperPerms you can now use the following nodes with towny.

	- Town spawn cost now outputs correctly formatted by the settings in your economy plugin.
	- Fixed modplayername in chat format generating duplicate entries.
	- Optimized Towny chat so it no longer performs lots of wasteful string parsing on every message.

	- Towny World commands are now admin only again.
	- Fixed a world bug where Plot revert was following wild revent instead of it's own setting.
	- Requires CraftBukkit 1302 as a minimum, to clear memory leaks.
	- Added access from console for '/ta givebonus', and expanded to allow a town or a player to give the bonus to.
	  (bonus given to the player is directly transfered to the town)

	- Pistons can now push between town owned townblocks.

	- Animals in towns can now only be killed by residents of that town. Unless PVP is enabled.
	- TownBlocks reposessed by the Mayor/Assistants now correctly remove the block from the Residents data files.
	- Added Plot level permissions and commands to control them.
	  '/plot perm' displays the current plots permissions.
	  '/plot set perm [on/off] or [resident/friend/ally/outsider] [build/destroy/switch/itemuse] [on/off]'
	- Added 23 and 107 to Switch Id's (Dispenser and Fence Gate).

	- Fixed TownClaim/unclaim thread not correctly selecting the town when the command was issued by an admin.
	- Towny will now kick players who use hacked clients and join with no name, rather than crash.
	- Moved all Towny messaging to it's own class. Depreciated old methods in TownyUniverse.
	- All '/ta' commands are now accessable ingame and at the console, excluding '/ta town/nation name add' for console.
	- Fixed an error with the new bukkit config failing to set a value (debug/devmode etc)
	- Temporary fix for prefixes not being updated in Towny when a player changes permissions groups etc.
	- Revert the PEX change as they reverted their change of .has() for release.

	- Town and Nation economy accounts are now restricted to 32 characters in length.
	- Possible fix for Essentials teleport refusing to engage and towny defaulting to it's own timer.
	- Moved all chat handling to a seperate jar (TownyChat.jar).
	  TownyChat is a Fully functional chat manager. If it's enabled it will handle all chat and supports custom chat channels.
	  This new system supports total customization of chat.
	  It supports custom chat channels, with access control via permission nodes.

	    /a (admin chat) permission node: towny.chat.admin
	    /m (moderators chat) permission node: towny.chat.mod
	  TownyChat also supports other chat plugins (herochat, iChat etc). To use another chat plugin with Towny...
