Here are instructions for installing Towny for the first time.


= Install Instructions =

  # Stop your server completely.
  # Download Towny.jar and save/copy it to your Plugins folder. (Optionally, Download Questioner as well.)
  # Start your server.
  # Stop your server.
  # Navigate to /Plugins/Towny/Settings/
    * Open *config.yml*
    * Carefully configure config.yml to your liking. Read the [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/towny/source/browse/trunk/Towny/src/plugin.yml Default config.yml] wiki page.
    * Set townblock size, default 16x16 (Cannot be changed later!)
    * Pay close attention to the Plugin Interfacing section, you'll enable Essentials, Questioner, the permissions plugin of your choice, and select your economy plugin here.
    * Set wilderness flags only if you are *not* using Permissions.
    * Save config.yml.
  # *If you use Permissions you MUST configure your [PermissionNodes permission nodes], as they are required for players to be able to build/mine in the wilderness.*
    * towny.wild.(asterisk) 
    * *or*
    * towny.wild.build
    * towny.wild.destroy
    * towny.wild.switch
    * towny.wild.item_use
    * towny.wild.block.{block id}.asterisk 
    * towny.wild.block.{block id}.build 
    * towny.wild.block.{block id}.destroy 
    * towny.wild.block.{block id}.switch 
    * towny.wild.block.{block id}.itemuse

  # Depending on how you configured your config.yml you may need to grant these permission nodes:
    * towny.town.new : User is able to create a town (used only when town_creation_admin_only: true)
    * towny.town.claim : User is able to expand his town with /town claim (used when world is set as unclaimable in /townyworld)
    * towny.town.resident : User is able to join a town.
    * towny.town.plot : User is able to use the /plot command, to buy and sell land personally.
    * towny.nation.new : User is able to create a nation (used only when nation_creation_admin_only: true)
    * towny.spawntp :Use /town spawn (requires allow_town_spawn: true set in the config.)
    * towny.publicspawntp : Use "/town spawn {town}" (teleport to other towns) (requires allow_town_spawn_travel: true in set in the config.)

  # Last but not least grant yourself:
    * towny.admin


Your server is ready to use Towny!
