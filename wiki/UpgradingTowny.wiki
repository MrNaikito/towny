= Introduction =

Here are instructions for upgrading to Towny 0.72:


= Upgrade Instructions =

  * Stop your server completely.
  * Download Towny.jar and save/copy it to your Plugins folder. (Optionally, Download Questioner as well.)
  * Backup your entire server! 
  * If you used custom Nation-levels.csv snd Town-levels.csv, back them up as they will be over-written.
  * Start your server.
  * Stop your server.
  * Navigate to /Plugins/Towny/Settings/
    * Open *config.properties* (unused now) and *config.yml*
    * Carefully configure config.yml to the settings you used in config.properties, [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/towny/source/browse/trunk/Towny/src/plugin.yml using this as a guide.]
    * If you are using Groupmanager set {{{using_permissions: true}}}
    * NOTE: The .csv files are no longer being used. Instead the entries in config.yml are used.
    * Save config.yml and optionally, discard config.properties.
  * *If you use Permissions you MUST configure your [PermissionNodes permission nodes], as they are required for players to be able to build/mine in the wilderness.*
    * towny.wild.(asterisk) 
  * or
    * towny.wild.build
    * towny.wild.destroy
    * towny.wild.switch
    * towny.wild.item_use
    * towny.wild.{blockid}

Your server is ready to use Towny 0.72!

  * Start your server.
  * If you would like to use the updated list of itemIDs ignored in the wilderness (only used if players cannot build/destroy freely in the wild,) use /tw set usingdefault in each world.
