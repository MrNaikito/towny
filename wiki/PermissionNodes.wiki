<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

Towny makes use of Permission nodes to customize the Towny experience to different player-ranks. It does this via an external permission plugin but also natively via the Townyperms.yml file located in the towny\settings\ folder. 

By default the townyperms.yml will have all the nodes given to the necessary players. You can customize it as you like. For more info on configuring townyperms.yml see the How Towny Works wikipage.

Since townyperms handles most of Towny's permission nodes the only ones you will probably have to add to your permission plugin's node file will be the nodes in the admin/moderator section found below.

Using a permission plugin such as Group Manager or bPerms is highly recommended. If you do not use a permissions plugin make sure that Towny's config has using_permissions: false. (It is not recommended to not use a permissions plugin, there are some very useful parts of towny which cannot be customized without using a permissions plugin.

= Info/Option Nodes =

  This is similar to a permission node as it is added to your permission nodes file(s). Added to the info: section of Groupmanagers' groups or the options: section of PEX's groups.
  
  * Setting default chat channels/modes on join to the server.
    * towny_default_modes: 'map,townclaim,plotborder,global,local,town,nation,mod,admin'
      * sets the default modes on residents, found in the /res set mode command stub.
      * puts players into a townychat chatchannel when they join the server.  
  
  * towny_maxplots: {number}
    This info node is used to limit the number of plots a player can own based on what permissions group they are in. If a group doesn't have this node or the node is set to -1 Towny will default back to the max_plots_per_resident in config.
    Setting max_plots_per_resident to -1 with no permission node, or a node set to -1 will allow infinite plots.
  
    Example:
    {{{
  		groups:
  		  Default:
  		    default: true

  		    - general.spawn
