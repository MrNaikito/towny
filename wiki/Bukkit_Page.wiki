[LIST]
[*]Added nation bank caps and a toggle to enable/disable withdrawls from nation banks (prevent players  hiding money in nationbanks on PVP worlds)
[*](Online) to title Resident Status
[*]Neutral in Nation status.
[*]Plot Regeneration
[INDENT=1]When a town plot is unclaimed (by a player or through upkeep) it will slowly begin to revert to a pre town state.
Blocks will slowly change back to whatever blocks we're present at the moment the town block was claimed.
You can configure certain block types you don't want restored to prevent players exploiting regen for diamond ores.
Block types to not restore are configured in block_ignore in the worlds txt file data/worlds/worldname.txt
Does not affect plots claimed pre-0.76.1[/INDENT]
[*] Added a block deletion function to remove specified blocks when a town block becomes unclaimed (By a player or through upkeep.)
[INDENT=1]This is useful for removing Lockette/Deadbolt signs on doors and chests.
Default list includes doors, signs, torchs, redstone + redstone accessories and is set in the config.yml
Block types to remove are configured in unclaim_delete in the worlds txt file data/worlds/worldname.txt[/INDENT]
[*] Added a max_tax_amount and max_tax_percent to the config for towns. Defaults to 1000 and 25% respetively.
[*] Titles and surnames can now contain spaces.
[*] Added a new setting 'regen_delay'.
[INDENT=1]This setting is in seconds. It will allow players to break protected blocks in the wild and towns, even if they dont have permission.
Blocks in the switchID list cannot be destroyed.
The blocks will drop no loot and will regenerate after the specified time.
Defaults to 0 (disabled). This shouldn't be used, will probably be worked into war updates.[/INDENT]
[*] Added a broadcast if a Nation is disbanded due to a town deletion.
[*] Added a new Default new world setting (wild_revert_on_mob_explosion). When enabled this will replace blocks destroyed by creature explosions in the wild.
[*] Towny will now clean up it's backup folder. Default time to keep backups is 90 days (configurable in config).
[*] Players can no longer attack another players tamed wolf if in a non PVP area (can attack own).

[spoiler=Changelog][B]Changelog[/B]
v0.76.0:
    - Added Town Buy command. Is defaulted to be empty. Currently only has ability to buy bonus blocks up until a set limit.
      '/town buy'
      '/town buy bonus [n]'
    - [Bonus: 0] is now hidden from the status when the town has no bonus blocks.
    - Added: [Bought: 0/max] to /town.
    - Fixed the shutdown of the Teleport warmup timer on restarts.
    - Fixed enabling Devmode, debug and reading integers from the config.
    - Added town bank caps and a toggle to enable/disable withdrawls from town banks (prevent players hiding money in towns on PVP worlds) - thanks phrstbrn
    - New command '/townyadmin toggle withdraw'.
    - Added two new commands to see who's online
      '/town online'
      '/nation online'
    - Fix for deleted residents in friend lists causing errors upon deletion, and the same error with nation deletion and enemy/ally lists.
    - Prevent sticky pistons pulling blocks across plot boundaries (if different owners).
    - Fix for getLastLocation() needing to throw a NullPointerException. The players location is now set upon creation of the cache.
    - Added a Maxplots permissions node. If a group doesn't have this node or the node is set to -1 Towny will default back to the max_plots_per_resident in config.
      Setting max_plots_per_resident to -1 with no permission node, or a node set to -1 will allow infinite plots.

      Eg usage:

        groups:
          Default:
            default: true
            permissions:
            - general.spawn
            inheritance: []
            info:
              prefix: ''
              build: true
              suffix: ''
              towny_maxplots: 1
          Admins:
            default: false
            permissions:
            - '*'
            inheritance:
            info:
              prefix: ''
              build: true
              suffix: ''
